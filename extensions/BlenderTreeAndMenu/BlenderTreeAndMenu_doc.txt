=BlenderTreeAndMenu=
This is a rewrite of the well-known TreeAndMenu extension, driven by the following problems:
*Tam wasn’t cachable with condcache, due to the fact it produces its final JS code in a late step (using parserAfterTidy hook…).
*Tam was using an old and deprecated way to parse its content, which has the side effect to reset the parser (and hence lose most of current “context”).

It should be a drop-in replacement to tam functions, in that #cachable_(tree/menu) use exactly the same parameters and syntax as #(tree/menu). However, all the parsing is done in the main parser step, and generated JS code is protected by stripping the result in wiki output…

IMPORTANT: #cachable_menu '''has not been tested at all!''' Will do when need rises – time is precious!
